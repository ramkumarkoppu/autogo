"""Remote execution over SSH with a GPU-enabled docker run.

Usage as a library:

    from infra.remote_exec import Job, load_cluster, run_pool, run_one

    workers, image = load_cluster(role="collect")
    jobs = [Job(name="job1", inner_cmd="uv run ..."), ...]
    results = run_pool(workers, image, gpu=True, jobs=jobs, logs_dir=Path("logs"))

Usage as a CLI (single command on first matching worker):

    uv run python -m infra.remote_exec \\
        --role train \\
        --log-path logs/train.log \\
        -- uv run experiments/foo/train.py --args

Assumes the cluster nodes share /workspace and /data/eric via NFS, have docker
installed, and have the image already pulled.
